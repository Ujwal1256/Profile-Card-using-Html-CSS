Create a sleek profile card project using HTML and CSS. The profile card features a clean layout with a rounded image at the top, displaying the individual's name and job title. Beneath, a brief description introduces the person. The design incorporates a subtle box shadow and borders for a polished look. Social media links are included at the bottom, offering a professional touch. Customize the content and styling easily to suit individual preferences. The project is responsive and visually appealing, making it ideal for personal portfolios or professional websites.
